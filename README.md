  <p>
    I developed this project entirely on my own using React Native with Expo. In it, I demonstrate most of the essential skills a mobile developer needs to know, such as screen navigation with Expo Router, a full CRUD implementation, global state management with Zustand, and much more. I primarily tailored this app for Android since I don't have a MacBook to test and modify the aspects specific
  <p>
    For the backend, I used Firebase, which made the implementation of authentication straightforward. The database was used to manage task creation, where I established relationships between tasks and users, ensuring that only the user who created a task can access it, and the task is stored in their account. I also used Firebase Storage, allowing users to edit their profile and upload a photo.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a simple task management app where users can create, delete, and edit tasks, as well as set reminders for each task, which trigger notifications so nothing is forgotten. I also implemented push notification functionality, enabling notifications to be sent from the Firebase console to users who have the app installed.
